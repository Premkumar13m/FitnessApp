             It can be easy to become a couch potato and pass up your regular
             exercise routine while social distancing at home during the COVID-19
             pandemic. Although it can be tempting to binge watch your favorite
             shows for hours, there can be negative health consequences to a lack
             of physical activity. These include increasing your risk for high
             blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease and depression, as well as
             decreasing your overall immune system functioning. Now more than ever,
             it's important that we work to improve our overall health.

           So, how much should we be exercising? Experts recommend at least 150
           minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week to lower your risk of
           heart disease. Weight loss experts recommend at least 200 minutes of
           exercise per week to maintain a healthy weight.

           If these numbers seem out of your reach right now, that's OK. The
           research is clear: even adding a small amount of exercise can have a
           positive impact on your health. Although gyms are closed, we can still
           make the choice to get or stay active. We may need to change how we do
           things, but we can still reap the benefits of exercising during these
           challenging times.
